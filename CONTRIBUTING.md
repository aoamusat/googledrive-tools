# Current Issues
The following are some of the current issues
- When a file is upload to the drive when you run the script from terminal, it cannot be found anywhere when you login into the associated google drive account. But the file can be downloaded (using the file ID) when you run the script from terminal. We're looking forward to having a folder ID in the upload function of the script so that a file can be uploaded to the specified folder. If a folder ID argument is not specified, the file will be uploaded to the Google Drive root folder.
- We're looking forward to having a function that will enable us to upload a specified folder on local machine to google drive.
